<BODY><H1><A name="mark status en masse"></A>Mass deleting books from the listing service inventory</H1>
<P>There are times that you have to delete books that are duplicates in the inventory of the listing service.&nbsp; <STRONG>The only way this can be accomplished is to mark them as "Sold".</STRONG>&nbsp; The following instructions will accomplish this.</P>
<H2>1.&nbsp; Backup your database</H2>
<P><IMG align=bottom src="images/image42.png"></P>
<P>We highly suggest you backup your previous state of the database just in case you make changes you wish you hadn't.&nbsp; Simply click on the Menu-&gt;Database-&gt;Backup.&nbsp; You will see the status in the Status Panel when completed.&nbsp; At that time you may go on to Step 2.</P>
<H2>2.&nbsp; Select books that are to be deleted</H2>
<P><IMG align=bottom src="images/image44.png"></P>
<P>Go to the Mass Changes tab; select each book from the Database Panel by holding the CTRL key and left-clicking each entry.&nbsp; When completed, each entry that is to be marked as "Sold" will be dark blue in color as above.&nbsp; An alternative method of marking is to mark the first entry by left-clicking, then scroll down to the last entry to be marked, hold the Shift key and left-click the last entry.&nbsp; It might take some practice, but it is faster than clicking each book individually.</P>
<P><IMG align=bottom src="images/image45.png"></P>
<P>In the Mass Changes page,&nbsp;click on the "Mark Sold" button and each book that you previously marked in Step 1 will be updated.&nbsp; Marking a book as "Sold" is the same thing as deleting it from the listing services.&nbsp; Note that when you change pages, the records no longer appear selected (dark blue)... don't worry, they are still selected, unless you click the Database Panel again, which will un-select them.</P>
