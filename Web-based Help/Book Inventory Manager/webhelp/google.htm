<P>There are several things that must be accomplished before you can upload your inventory to Google Merchant Center.&nbsp; You must register, set your options in the Inventory Program and then you are able to automatically upload with 1-click to Google Merchant Center.</P>
<H2><U>1.&nbsp; Google Setup</U></H2>
<UL>
<LI>If you don't already have a Google account, go <A href="http://www.google.com/support/merchants/bin/answer.py?answer=188486" target=_blank>here</A> to create one. </LI></UL>
<H2>2. &nbsp;Registering with Google</H2>
<P>Registering with Google Merchant Center is a five (5) step process.&nbsp; They must be done in order, and where indicated by Google, you must wait for a response before continuing to the next step.&nbsp; So go to&nbsp;the Google Merchant Center - Bulk Upload&nbsp;Instructions <A href="http://base.google.com/base/overview.html">page</A>&nbsp;and follow the directions.&nbsp; The following notes may help:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Item type should be set to "Products" and the Data Feed name should be the same as what you have in Registered File Name above.&nbsp; Make sure you don't delete this data feed on the Google site, otherwise you will have to register it all over again, which is not a big deal, but would have to be done. 
<LI><STRONG>Don't forget to set up a FTP Account (without this, we can't upload to Google Merchant Center) by going to the Settings page, and click on the FTP acccount tab.</STRONG> 
<LI>Next, you have to manually upload <STRONG>one</STRONG> (and only one book!) book to Google Merchant Center, which will register your "data feed" (the file we send to Google Merchant Center). 
<LI>For "creating the Bulk Upload", take one or two of your books and "update" them so they will show up in the "files waiting to be exported" count.&nbsp; Make sure that you have the User ID and Password set correctly on the User IDs and Password page in the Inventory program.&nbsp; Then do an upload to Google Merchant Center.&nbsp; Make sure you have checked Google Merchant Center on the upload page. 
<LI>Once this is done, you will receive an email from Google Merchant Center stating that your file has been accepted.&nbsp; <STRONG>If Google does not accept your file, and you can't figure out what you did wrong, please notify us, and we will try to help you through this.&nbsp; It's a confusing process until you have done it once, and the Google staff is wonderful in helping you fix any of your&nbsp;problems.</STRONG></LI></OL>
<P><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</P>
<H2><U>3.&nbsp; Normal uploading to Google</U></H2>
<P>Once you have registered, and Google has accepted your file, you need to place your User ID and Password in the program, by going to the User ID's and Passwords page and entering them.&nbsp; <STRONG>This is the User ID and Password you created on the FTP Account page.&nbsp; Don't forget to save them!</STRONG></P><p align="right"><font size=1>Created using <a href="http://www.helpmatic.net" target="_blank">Helpmatic Pro HTML</a></font></p>
