<BODY><H1>Images</H1>
<P>First of all, the actual image is&nbsp;not stored in the database; the location of the image on your machine is what is stored in the database.&nbsp; So, if at a later time you decide to move your images to another folder, you will have to&nbsp;update each record in the database with the new image&nbsp;location.&nbsp; For this reason, we suggest you make a new directory where you have the Backup and Export directories (folders).&nbsp; </P>
<P>And at the present time, the actual images are not uploaded to the listing services because there is no easy way to do this.&nbsp; Very few of the listing services accept images, and there is no common way to upload them; each service is different.&nbsp; We are working on a solution to this problem.&nbsp; Basically, images are for your use.&nbsp; If you want to upload them, you have to create them in a format that each listing service will accept and then manually upload them.&nbsp; </P>
<H2>Adding or&nbsp;Changing Images</H2>
<P><IMG align=bottom src="images/image64.png"></P>
<P>To Add or Change an image for this selected record (you must select a record that this image will belong to), click on Select Image, and a Open Dialog (that's what we call it) will appear..</P>
<P><IMG align=bottom src="images/image65.png"></P>
<P>Change directories until you have the directory where your images are stored and select one for this book's record.</P>
<P><IMG align=bottom src="images/image66.png"></P>
<P>Figure 60c.&nbsp; Once you have clicked the Open button (as shown in Figure 60b above), you will see your image in the image box for that record.&nbsp; The Update Book button will turn red, telling you that if you want to save this image filename with the record, you must click <STRONG>Update</STRONG>.&nbsp; The image filename is now attached and stored with this record in the database.</P>
<H2>Deleting Images</H2>
<P>To delete an image click delete.&nbsp; There is no need to click Update because the deletion is done automatically.</P>
