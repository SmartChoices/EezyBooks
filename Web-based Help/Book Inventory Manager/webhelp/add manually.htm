<BODY><H1>Adding a book manually</H1>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H2>Check Options</H2>
<P><IMG align=bottom src="images/image37.png"></P>
<P>When adding books to the database, you have limited control of the&nbsp;SKU (Stock Unit, a unique number used to identify <EM>this</EM> book) field.&nbsp; This is the key in the database, which must be unique.&nbsp; There are two ways you can enter this information:</P>
<OL>
<LI>On the Program Options page (see figure above), there is an option for Automatic SKU Numbering.&nbsp; When this option is selected (as evidenced by the check by the Auto Numbering field) the&nbsp;SKU field&nbsp; on the Book Detail page is disabled (greyed-out) and the number is automatically generated by adding 1 to the last number on file.&nbsp; This field is updated when the Add button is clicked. Note:&nbsp; when using Auto-Numbering,&nbsp;the number will automatically be expanded to 10 digits by padding on the left with zeros. &nbsp;NOTE:&nbsp; Unless you want to start with the number 1, you should enter your choice for the starting number and&nbsp;click Add &nbsp;<EM>before clicking Auto Numbering.</EM> 
<LI>If you choose to enter your own SKU, do not check Auto Numbering, in which case the field is enabled to allow you to enter the SKU.&nbsp; Remember, this number <STRONG><U>must be unique.</U></STRONG> 
<LI>A new feature is how multiple copies are handled.&nbsp; You can either have one SKU for each copy, or you can have all copies under one SKU.&nbsp; The secret is in the quantity field;&nbsp; When you have one SKU for each book and if the quantity field is zero, the book is considered <STRONG>sold.</STRONG>&nbsp; If you have one SKU for multiple copies of a book, and you sell one of the copies, you must decrement your copy count.&nbsp; The program will not do it for you, since it does not know how many copies you have sold.&nbsp; When the quantity count goes to zero, the book is then marked sold which indicates no more copies are available.</LI></OL>
<P><STRONG><U></U></STRONG>&nbsp;</P>
<H2>Adding the book when you have an ISBN...</H2>
<P><IMG align=bottom src="images/image39.png"></P>
<P>To add a book manually for when you <EM>have</EM> the ISBN requires the following steps:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Click on the Clear button&nbsp;to clear the Detail panel of any existing prior data (failure to do this will result in the prior data being carried forward to the current book being added).&nbsp; Notice the yellow highlighting on some of the input entries.&nbsp; This indicates the minimum amount of information that is required for entering a book into the database. 
<LI>Enter the&nbsp;ISBN in the text box and click on Get Book Info (with ISBN).&nbsp; If you have a barcode scanner, just click on the textbox for ISBN and scan the book's ISBN with your scanner.&nbsp; The ISBN will automatically be decoded and placed in the ISBN textbox. This&nbsp;requires an internet connection for the program to be able to find the book information on the internet.&nbsp; It takes a few seconds for the data to appear, automatically being populated in the Title, Author, Publisher text boxes depending on what was found.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Auto Pricing Lookup Option was checked,&nbsp;any pricing information is displayed in the <A href="panels.htm#pricing lookup">Pricing&nbsp;Results</A>&nbsp;task panel.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, enter the data, checking the appropriate boxes for Binding, Condition, etc. into the appropriate spots in the Detail Panel.&nbsp; If you don't like the default selections in Binding, Condition, etc., you can enter your own data in the selected box rather than using the down arrow.&nbsp; The drop-down boxes for Binding, Condition, Jacket, Type and Edition allow you to enter your own text if you don't like what you see in the list.&nbsp; But, if you don't use the supplied condition, some data being sent to some of the listing services (namely Amazon.com) will not be translated correctly (you will be warned).&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<LI>If you want to have canned text, which makes it more easier to add repetitive text to the description field, go to the <A href="panels.htm#canned text">Canned Text tab</A>, fill out the title and text and then click on the buttons.&nbsp; You can have up to five different canned texts.&nbsp; The limit of the Description is 500 characters. 
<LI>To enter this book into a catalog, press the&nbsp;Select Catalog button next to the Catalog entry box;&nbsp; the Catalog tab will open, where you can select a catalog.&nbsp; The selection you make will be populated to the Catalog entry automatically.&nbsp; <STRONG>Do not try to add catalog entries in this box;</STRONG> you must go to the <A href="panels.htm#catalogs">Catalog Task</A> tab (also where you can find the information about sub-catalogs) to make any&nbsp;additions or deletions&nbsp;to the catalog file.&nbsp; 
<LI>Private Notes <STRONG>do not</STRONG> get exported to the listing services, they only appear in the database. 
<LI>If you didn't check Auto Pricing Lookup in the Program Options, you can still get prices from the internet.&nbsp; Once you have the&nbsp;information entered, you can automatically pass this to&nbsp;the pricing routines&nbsp;by clicking on the&nbsp;<STRONG>Get Prices from Internet</STRONG>&nbsp;button.&nbsp; This will automatically go to&nbsp;the internet&nbsp;for pricing as seen in the figure below. 
<LI>
<P>Finally, when you are satisfied all of the data is correct, simply press the Add button.&nbsp; Enter the <STRONG>total number of copies you have to add</STRONG> in the window next to the Add button and it will clone that many of copies if you have checked <STRONG>Multiple Copies &gt; Multiple SKU's </STRONG>on the Program Options page, in which case each copy will have it's own SKU.</P></LI></OL>
<H2>&nbsp;</H2>
<H2>Adding the book when you <EM>don't</EM> have an ISBN...</H2>
<P>To add a book manually for when you <EM>don't have</EM> the ISBN requires the following steps:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Click on the Clear button&nbsp;to clear the Detail panel of prior data (failure to do this will result in the prior data being carried forward to the current book being added).&nbsp; Notice the yellow highlighting on some of the input entries.&nbsp; This indicates the minimum amount of information that is required for entering a book into the database. 
<LI>Enter the Title and Author in the spaces provided, along with&nbsp;any of the other information that you have for this book.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you have finished entering the book information (as indicated above as if you had an ISBN), you can get the pricing information by clicking&nbsp;<STRONG>Get Info (w/o ISBN)</STRONG>&nbsp;which will transfer the Title and Author to Biblio.com to find the pricing information for that book.&nbsp; Scroll through the information returned to establish a starting price for the book.&nbsp; If you wish to use another web site other than Biblio.com, you can select that site by clicking on the button for that site.&nbsp; Biblio.com is the default at this time, buy you can also choose AddAll.com or Bookfinder.com.&nbsp; Just enter the book information in the spaces provided as you would normally do with that website, and press Enter on your keyboard.&nbsp; (This tab acts like a mini web browser window so you can do almost everything in this tab that you could do with a full size browser.)</LI></OL>
<H2><BR>The scoop about Shipping...</H2>
<P><IMG align=middle src="images/image73.png"></P>
<P>As you can see, things have changed with respect to shipping, thanks to Amazon.com' new requirements.&nbsp; If you just want the normal shipping, then click on <STRONG>Domestic Standard.&nbsp; </STRONG>If you offer expedited domestic shipping, then click either <STRONG>Domestic Expedited</STRONG>, <STRONG>Two Day</STRONG> or <STRONG>One Day Domestic</STRONG>.&nbsp; You will notice that the later two are for Amazon only, and are not exported to other venues.&nbsp; International Standard and Expedited are also available for all venues.</P>
<H2><BR><BR>Relisting a book</H2>
<P>There is also a <STRONG>Relist button</STRONG> which will only work when the book's status is Sold and the quantity is zero (0); therefore, do not change the quantity to a positive number, just click&nbsp;the Relist button.&nbsp; It's function is to allow the book to be relisted if it is returned, etc.&nbsp; The book will have a new SKU (which is the key into the database) and will be marked For Sale.&nbsp; Otherwise, it is an exact duplicate of the book that was sold but being returned.&nbsp; </P>
<H2>Getting current pricing information...</H2>
<P>Once you have added books, the price you have entered can be compared against what the competition is selling the same book for.&nbsp; Use the <STRONG><A href="repricing.htm">Re-pricing Tool</A></STRONG> tab to start the re-pricing routine after you have entered all of your books for the day.&nbsp; This will bring your prices more inline with what is current.</P>
<H2>Amazon volume information</H2>

To list multiple volumes from an incomplete set, list each book individually as a single volume.</SPAN></P>
