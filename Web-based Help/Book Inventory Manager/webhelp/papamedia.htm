<BODY><H1>Setup for Papa Media venue</H1>
<H2><U>General Information</U></H2>
<P>Papa Media is a listing venue that only charges for books sold, not for listing on their site.&nbsp; Therefore, there is much interest in how we interact with the Papa Media site.&nbsp; For starters, uploading to the Papa Media site is a bit different, in that they "pull" the files we upload to our server.&nbsp; This is different from most of the other sites in that it does NOT go directly to the Papa Media site - they visit our server several times a day to get the files that users have uploaded.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Once you have all of your inventory in the Prager Inventory program,&nbsp;the next thing you have to do is put your email address&nbsp;on the User ID and Password page, next to the Papa Media line.&nbsp; There is no password required. 
<LI>Next, go to the <A href="export.htm">Export page</A> and create a series of export files;&nbsp; there will be several types of files, UIEE, Tab-delimited, HomeBase,etc.&nbsp; You will not see one for Papa Media because we have created it under a different name, and the program will automatically find the correct file to export. 
<LI>Finally, go to the Upload page (you should be taken there automatically upon completion of the Export) and click on the checkbox next to Papa Media.&nbsp; Then click on the Upload button. 
<LI>You can watch the status of the upload process in the yellow window.&nbsp; If there are any errors that you don't understand, contact us.</LI></UL>
