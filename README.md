Prager, Software
=====================

I spent many years developing the software which I have placed in this repository.  Please read the license; it is a normal MIT license, with the exception that you MAY NOT sell any application that you derive from the code in this repository without specific written permission from Prager, Software.

The code is well documented internally; help files can be found on the applicable website: http://www.pragersoftware.com.  If you have any questions, I will be happy to answer them as long as they are on a time-available basis.  That means I might not be able to respond to you as quickly as I would like to.  Please feel free to use the code as an example of what-might-have-been had I had the time to make all of the changes requested.
