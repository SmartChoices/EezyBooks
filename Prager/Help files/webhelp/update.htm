<BODY><H1>Updating book details</H1>
<P><IMG src="images/help figure 1g.png" align=bottom></P>
<P>A new feature is how multiple copies are handled.&nbsp; You can either have one SKU for each copy, or you can have all copies under one SKU.&nbsp; The secret is in the quantity field;&nbsp; When you have one SKU for each book and if the quantity field is zero, the book is considered sold.&nbsp; If you have one SKU for multiple copies of a book, and you sell one of the copies, you must decrement your copy count.&nbsp; The program will not do it for you, since it does not know how many copies you have sold.&nbsp; When the quantity count goes to zero, the book is then marked sold which indicates no more copies are available.</P>
<P>To update any of the book details, select the book from the Database Panel and make changes to any field <EM>except</EM> the Book # field (that is the database key and will not allow changes).&nbsp; Notice that when you make any changes, the Update button will turn red; this is to remind you that updates are pending.&nbsp; Click Update; the database now has the updated information.&nbsp; Note that you can only update a book&nbsp;if it's status is For Sale.&nbsp; If you need to relist the book because it was returned, etc., you can use the Relist button.&nbsp; This only works if the book has a status of Sold; if you are supplying your own book numbers, the Book # text box becomes enabled so you can enter a&nbsp;different book number&nbsp;(NOTE:&nbsp; if you use the same number, the system will assign the next highest <STRONG>numeric</STRONG> book number&nbsp;)&nbsp; The "Date Last Updated" field will reflect the current date and time of the update.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H2><U>Mass changes</U></H2>
<P><IMG src="images/help figure 10.png" align=bottom></P>
<P>If you want to only change the Satus of your books, use this panel.&nbsp; This is used when you have duplicate books on a listing service and you need to mark them as "Sold" which will cause the listing service to drop the books from their inventory.</P>
<P>For instructions on how to change the status of books en masse, see <A href="listing service mass delete.htm#mark status en masse">Delete Books from the Listing Service</A></P>
<P>You can also make "mass" changes to <STRONG>every book in the database</STRONG> by supplying the information used to find the books that match your criteria.&nbsp; Simply select the field in the "Change the" box and fill in the "from" and "to" fields.&nbsp; On checkboxes, such as Expedited Shipping and Int'l Shipping, the database may carry a "Null" value rather than the customary 'Y' or 'N'.&nbsp; If your changes do not appear to work, try the change again with the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>set the 'from' field to <STRONG>NULL</STRONG> 
<LI>set the 'to' field to either&nbsp;<STRONG>N</STRONG> or&nbsp;<STRONG>Y</STRONG> as you choose</LI></UL>
