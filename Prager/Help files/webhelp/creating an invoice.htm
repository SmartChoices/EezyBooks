<BODY><H1>Creating an Invoice</H1>
<H2><U>On the Inventory Side...</U></H2>
<P>Normally, unless you really want to, there is no need to create an invoice if the listing service provides you with one.&nbsp; However, some of them, like Choosebooks (ZVAB) don't provide an invoice, so you need to make one.&nbsp; In those cases,&nbsp;what follows are directions on how&nbsp;to create an invoice...</P>
<P><IMG src="images/help figure 1.png" align=bottom></P>
<P>This is the detail panel.&nbsp; The idea is to transfer a book into the Shopping Cart by clicking on the Shopping Cart button.&nbsp; This will accomplish three things:</P>
<UL>
<LI>mark the selected book sold if it is&nbsp;not already so marked 
<LI>update the database (this record will be part of the next export and upload) 
<LI>transfer the book information to the shopping cart itself</LI></UL>
<H2><U></U>&nbsp;</H2>
<H2><U>On the Customer Info Tab...</U></H2>
<P><IMG src="images/help figure 37.png" align=bottom></P>
<P>Customer information is either entered on this screen&nbsp;or picked from what is pre-listed under Customer Data.&nbsp; The only field that is required is the Customer ID field.&nbsp; Once all of the information has been entered, click on the&nbsp;yellow arrow to transfer the information to the actual Invoice form (see figure below).</P>
<H2><U></U>&nbsp;</H2>
<H2><U>On the Invoice Tab...</U></H2>
<P><IMG src="images/help figure 19.png" align=bottom></P>
<P>This shows that the book from the Inventory has been placed in the shopping cart and the Customer information has been transferred to the invoice for printing.&nbsp; <STRONG>First things first:</STRONG>&nbsp; you must change the logo and address listed in the invoice (for obvious reasons).&nbsp; <STRONG>You should change the address first, then the logo bitmap.</STRONG>&nbsp; You can change the logo by clicking on the <STRONG>Change logo and address</STRONG> button.&nbsp; A open-file dialog will appear and you should choose a file from the list; if your logo is already there and you just want to change the address, click on Cancel.&nbsp; The logo should be sized to fit, and with a format of <STRONG>.bmp</STRONG>.&nbsp; The address is changed by over-typing the information that is currently there (you have 2 lines, with a total length of 64 characters).&nbsp; Click on <STRONG>Change logo and address</STRONG> and the new information is saved.&nbsp; Now all that is left is to pick a payment method and generate the invoice number.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The invoice number is either automatically generated (if you have that option checked in Menu-&gt;Options, or you have to supply the invoice number.&nbsp; It must be unique from other Invoice number.&nbsp; If you are just getting started:</P>
<UL>
<LI>unclick the Auto-Generate Invoice numbers in the Options menu 
<LI>pick a starting invoice number and put it in the text box 
<LI>Add the invoice to the database 
<LI>check the Auto-Generate invoice numbers in the Options menu; now, for future invoices the next sequential numbe will be generated automatically.</LI></UL>
<P>The last thing is to preview the invoice before printing, if you desire.</P><p align="right"><font size=1>Created using <a href="http://www.helpmatic.net" target="_blank">Helpmatic Pro HTML</a></font></p>
