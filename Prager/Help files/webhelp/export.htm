<BODY><H1>Creating a file for export</H1>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><IMG src="images/help figure 9.png" align=bottom></P>
<P>There are two times when you might want to perform an export of your records:&nbsp; </P>
<OL>
<LI>when you are going to do a purge&nbsp;and replace&nbsp;of all of your records on a listing site, or 
<LI>when you are informing the site that you had activity on your inventory (books added, sold, etc.) by uploading to the site</LI></OL>
<P>Both are accomplished the same way:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Export files are always created using HomeBase, UIEE and tab-delimited formats, because some listing services require one or the other. (you don't have to worry about which file goes with which listing service, it is done automatically for you).&nbsp; Tab-delimited files are created in two possible formats: normal tab-delimited and Amazon.com-specific formats.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<LI>if you want to export <EM>all </EM>of your records, click "Export entire database".&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTE:&nbsp; At the end of the export, a message box will pop-up and will ask you&nbsp;if you are doing a purge/replace of the entire inventory.&nbsp; This affects the&nbsp;date "Changed Since"&nbsp; date which needs to be changed to match the exported file.&nbsp; This is done automatically by the program if you click Yes. (otherwise, you can really screw things up because the program won't know you did a purge and will again export&nbsp;all the records that have been changed since the date indicated).&nbsp; 
<LI>If you want to only export a&nbsp;sub-set of records that you have selected using the <A href="searching.htm">Inclusive Search feature</A>, check "Only those displayed...".&nbsp; What ever is showing in the Database Panel will then be included in the export file. 
<LI>if you only want to export the records that have changed since the last export, select "Changed since" button.</LI></UL>
<P>It is assumed that all of your user ID's's are identical for each of the&nbsp;listing services.&nbsp; The file that is exported has a User ID in the header; <STRONG>by default this ID is taken from the&nbsp;first user ID on the Upload Tab page </STRONG>for the appropriate file type<STRONG>.</STRONG></P>
<P>The export files&nbsp;are&nbsp;created automatically&nbsp;and placed&nbsp;in the C:\Prager\Export folder with the name looking like this:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"FFmmddyyyyhhmmss.txt"&nbsp; where</P>
<UL>
<LI>FF is either <STRONG>HB</STRONG> for HomeBase format, <STRONG>UI</STRONG> for UIEE format, <STRONG>TB</STRONG> for normal tab-delimited format or&nbsp; <STRONG>AZ</STRONG> for Amazon.com .&nbsp; 
<LI>mmddyyyy represents the date of the export 
<LI>hhmmss represents the time of the export.</LI></UL>
<P>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don't see the filename you expect, it is because there were no records to export, therefore the file was not created.</P>
<P>Records are only marked for export when added using the Add or Update buttons; <EM>they are not marked for export when added to the database using the Import function.</EM>&nbsp; An indication of how many records exported is displayed next to Records Processed:.&nbsp; The filename is also displayed for ease in finding it for <A href="upload.htm">uploading</A>.</P><p align="right"><font size=1>Created using <a href="http://www.helpmatic.net" target="_blank">Helpmatic Pro HTML</a></font></p>
