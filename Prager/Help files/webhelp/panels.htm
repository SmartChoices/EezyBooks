<H2><U>Initial Program Window</U></H2>
<H2><U><A name="initial window"></A></U></H2>
<H2><IMG src="images/help figure 1.png" width=0 align=bottom><IMG src="images/help figure 1.png" align=bottom></H2>
<P>Figure 1.&nbsp; This is a screen shot of the&nbsp;<EM>only</EM> window of the program.&nbsp; All panels are in this one window with tabs used to navigate from function to function.</P>
<P><A href="panels.htm#top of form">back to top</A>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H2><A name="database panel"></A><U>Database Panel</U></H2>
<H2><IMG src="images/help figure 2.png" align=bottom></H2>
<P>Figure 2.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the Database Panel.&nbsp; It contains the most common and needed information "in a nutshell".&nbsp; The fields automatically resize themselves to accommodate the longest field, such as the title.&nbsp;&nbsp;By clicking on an entry anywhere in the row, the record detail is populated to the Detail Panel shown in Figure 3.&nbsp; The&nbsp;highlighted row&nbsp;indicates which is the current record.&nbsp; By selecting any row, you will populate the Detail Panel (discussed next).&nbsp; If you want to sort the data shown, click on the column title (BookNbr, Title, etc.).&nbsp; </P>
<P>You can also reorder the columns by dragging the column title horizontally, or sort any of the columns by clicking the title of the column (eg BookNbr) once for ascending sequence and again for descending sequence (or visa versa).&nbsp; This is not maintained between executions of the program.</P>
<P><A href="Panels.htm#Top of Form">back to top</A></P>
<H2>&nbsp;</H2>
<H2><A name="detail panel"></A><U>Detail Panel</U></H2>
<H2><IMG src="images/help figure 3.png" align=bottom></H2>
<P>Figure 3.&nbsp; This shows the detail panel.&nbsp; All of the information contained in the database record is displayed in this panel.&nbsp; If any of the information is blank, it is not carried on the database and may be added to the record using this screen.&nbsp; There is hover-help (move your mouse over the control and let it sit for a few seconds) for each of the buttons with icons on them.&nbsp; The boxes containing binding, condition, etc are what are combo-boxes.&nbsp; If you don't like what you see in the list, add your own verbage.&nbsp; For instance, if you use different verbage for Condition, just enter it in the top of the list and it will be carried with the record to the database.</P>
<P>Each of the buttons are self-explanatory; notice that some of the fields have an asterisk (*) next to them... this means that if you click on the label (Cost for instance), that value is "frozen" or becomes a "stickey" so you don't have to re-enter it each time. </P>
<P><A href="Panels.htm#Top of Form">back to top</A></P>
<H2>&nbsp;</H2>
<H2><A name="status"></A><U>Status Panel</U></H2>
<P><IMG src="images/help figure 4.png" align=bottom></P>
<P>Figure 4.&nbsp; This is the Status Panel, where progress is indicated.&nbsp; Note that the most recent action is at the top of the list, known as a "push-down stack".</P>
<P><A href="Panels.htm#Top of Form">back to top</A></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H2><U>Search Tab</U></H2>
<H2><IMG src="images/help figure 5.png" align=bottom></H2>
<P>Figure 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;This tab&nbsp;allows you to control what is displayed in the Database Panel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It consists of three parts:</P>
<UL>
<LI>By checking any or all of the three checkboxes in the&nbsp;<STRONG>Display Criteria</STRONG> group, you can limit your display to&nbsp;only books For Sale, Sold,&nbsp;On Hold or within a certain Catalog.&nbsp; 
<LI>In the group <STRONG>Individual Search Selection</STRONG>, you can search for a particular book&nbsp;by entering the pertinent search data for ISBN, title, author or book number.&nbsp; As you enter the data, you will notice that the Database Panel will change with each character entered (called a drill-down search!). 
<LI>The third group called <STRONG>Inclusive Search</STRONG> gives you much latitude in what you are searching for.&nbsp; Almost any field in the database can be search on, with four different types of compares (equal, not equal, less than and greater than) against the data entered in the text box to the right of the comparator.&nbsp; This text box handles wild cards (currently only an asterisk ( * ) meaning "anything that follows" for the equal and not equal comparators.</LI></UL>
<P>The results of the selections will control what is diaplayed in the Database Panel, from where any book can be selected for expansion in the Detail Panel.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H2><U><A name="pricing service"></A>Re-Pricing Tool</U></H2>
<P><IMG src="images/help figure 56.png" align=bottom></P>
<P>Figure 56a.&nbsp; This is the first screen for the Re-Pricing Tool.&nbsp; It is self-explanatory.&nbsp; Make sure you highlight all fields that are to participate in the computation of a suggested price, otherwise you will get strange or no results.</P>
<P><IMG src="images/help figure 56b.png" align=bottom></P>
<P>Figure 56b.&nbsp; This is what the&nbsp;Re-Pricing Tool&nbsp;returns using the filters in Figure 56 above.&nbsp; It's pretty self explanatory.&nbsp; The prices are normally obtained from over 80 sites; however, sometimes a target site is down and the tool is unable to get any pricing information, as in line 6 above.&nbsp; The tool goes through your entire inventory, one book at a time, finding the lowest and highest prices.&nbsp; Once all of the prices have been obtained, an average is computed and also displayed, with a percent difference between your price and what you have chosen to match against.&nbsp; The suggested prices are computed based on the criteria you select on the panel as shown in Figure 56 above, with all types of combinations available.&nbsp; You need to check the books that you want to update.&nbsp; On the Filters tab, there is a button that you can check to update all books, with the exception of those whose current price&nbsp;is not different from the suggested new price.</P>
<P><A href="Panels.htm#Top of Form">back to top</A></P>

<H2><A name="isbn lookup"></A><A name="pricing lookup"></A><U>Pricing&nbsp;Results</U></H2>
<P><IMG src="images/help figure 6.png" align=bottom></P>
<P>Figure 6.&nbsp; This is the Pricing Lookup tab.&nbsp;&nbsp;When adding a book, if the Option "Auto Pricing Lookup" is checked, pricing information is also returned, saving you a trip to another web-site; you can also get the latest pricing information for books without ISBN's from AddAll.com by clicking on the Check Prices button.</P>
<P><A href="Panels.htm#Top of Form">back to top</A></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H2><U>Web Sites</U></H2>
<P><IMG src="images/help figure 32.png" align=bottom></P>
<P>Figure 7.&nbsp; This is the actual website for Biblio.com, AddAll.com or BookFinder.com, whichever is your preference..&nbsp; Just fill in the Author, Title and/or Keyword and click on the&nbsp;Search button, and you will get the results in this window.&nbsp; This is used when you don't have an ISBN to do a pricing lookup.&nbsp; <STRONG>You can also do this automatically by having Title and Author filled in in the Detail Panel and clicking the "Fill in Detail" button.</STRONG></P>
<P><A href="Panels.htm#Top of Form">back to top</A></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H2><A name="import-export"></A><U>Import</U></H2>
<P><IMG src="images/help figure 58.png" align=bottom></P>
<P>Figure 8.&nbsp; This is the Import tab.&nbsp; It is used to import files into the database and export files to the various listing services.&nbsp; </P>
<UL>
<LI>Importing is usually only done once, at the initial startup of the program.&nbsp; 
<LI>Pressing the browse button allows you to pick and choose the file to import or export.&nbsp; 
<LI>Export options control what is exported, either All of the books on file (typically used for a purge and replace) or only those from the last time exported. 
<LI>An indication of file processing progress is indicated by Records Processed.&nbsp; 
<LI>Duplicate keys can cause a problem in the database; therefore, you are given a choice as what to do when one is encountered.&nbsp; Reject the record is the default.</LI></UL>
<P><A href="Panels.htm#Top of Form">back to top</A></P>
<H2>&nbsp;</H2>
<H2><U>Export</U><A name="import-export"></A></H2>
<P><IMG src="images/help figure 9.png" align=bottom></P>
<P>Figure 9.&nbsp; This is the Export tab.&nbsp; It is used to import files into the database and export files to the various listing services.&nbsp; </P>
<UL>
<LI>Pressing the browse button allows you to pick and choose the file to&nbsp;export.&nbsp; 
<LI>Export options control what is exported, either All of the books on file (typically used for a purge and replace) or only those from the last time exported. 
<LI>The User ID field is used&nbsp;in the export file headers to identify your records to the listing service.&nbsp; You may change it for each exported file (ie. if you have different userid's for different listing services, then you can change the User ID here for each).&nbsp; </LI></UL>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H2><U>Alter Price/Status and other changes</U><A name="change prices"></A></H2>
<P><IMG src="images/help figure 10.png" align=bottom></P>
<P>Figure 10.&nbsp; This is the&nbsp;Alter Price/Status&nbsp;tab.&nbsp; It is used to:</P>
<UL>
<LI>reprice all or a selection of the books in inventory or 
<LI>change the status of books in the inventory en masse (ie. to delete duplicate books on the listing services)</LI></UL>
<P>You have control of increasing or decreasing the prices, either all of the books or only those within a certain price range and either by amount or percentage.&nbsp; I found this task to be one of the most significant tasks missing from the inventory program I was using, and therefore added it.&nbsp; Although this can be accomplished in some of the listing services, it is much better to have it done in the inventory program, where you have total control over the results.&nbsp;&nbsp; The bottom of this&nbsp;panel allows you to make mass changes to selected fields in the Books database.&nbsp; For instance, if you are moving books from one shelf to another, this allows you to change the Location from say, location 35 to location 86 with one command.&nbsp; The warning is there because of the potential damage that could be done if you are not careful.</P>
<P>For instructions on how to change the status of books en masse, see <A href="listing service mass delete.htm#mark status en masse">Delete Books from the Listing Service</A></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H2><A name="catalogs"></A><U>Catalogs</U></H2>
<P><IMG src="images/help figure 11.png" align=bottom></P>
<P>Figure 11.&nbsp; This is the Catalog Tab, which is active if you do not have "Use primary and secondary catalogs[" checked in the Program Options page.&nbsp; Here you can import from an external file to create your catalog, or enter and/or delete catalog&nbsp;entries manually.&nbsp; </P>
<P><A href="Panels.htm#Top of Form">back to top</A></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H2><A name="accounting"></A><U>Accounting</U></H2>
<P><IMG src="images/help figure 12.png" align=bottom></P>
<P>Figure 12.&nbsp; This is the Accounting tab.&nbsp; You will find current data regarding the number of books For Sale, Sold, on Hold, etc.&nbsp; In addition, Year-to-Date sales statistics are also displayed.&nbsp; The update button allows a refresh of the contents of this panel.</P>
<P><A href="Panels.htm#Top of Form">back to top</A></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H2><A name="uploads"></A><U>Uploading</U></H2>
<P><IMG src="images/help figure 13.png" align=bottom></P>
<P>Figure 13.&nbsp; The Upload Tab, where&nbsp;you can upload to any or all of&nbsp;ninteen (19)&nbsp;listing services, plus 4 custom sites.&nbsp; In addition, you can do a Test Upload, which takes a file with one record (marked Sold) and attempts to upload it.&nbsp; This is used for testing the connection and login parameters.&nbsp; The purge/replace is used to indicate if this upload is to be used to do a purge/replace.&nbsp;&nbsp; It has the effect of changing the filename to place the word "purge" in it so the appropriate listing services will recognize this is a purge/replace.</P>
<P><A href="Panels.htm#Top of Form">back to top</A></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H2><U>Canned Text</U></H2>
<P><A name="canned text"></A></P>
<P><IMG src="images/help figure 14.png" align=bottom></P>
<P>Figure 14.&nbsp; This tab gives you the ability to have "canned text" in the description field when adding a book.&nbsp; Create a title for the text (which gets transferred to the button on the detail panel above the Description field) and put your text in the box.&nbsp; Make sure you leave a space at the end so they don't run together.</P>
<P><A href="Panels.htm#Top of Form">back to top</A></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H2><U>Mapping</U></H2>
<P><IMG src="images/help figure 16.png" align=bottom></P>
<P>Figure 16.&nbsp; This is used during an import of a tab-delimited file.&nbsp; The program needs to know what columns in your file match to the items in the database.&nbsp; In that respect, you need to drag each column title (in the top box where "Item Number" is selected and drop it on the text-box that most closely relates to your column contents (as where "Item Number" is related to "Book Number".&nbsp; When you are done with all of the columns, press Continue to start the actual import.</P>
