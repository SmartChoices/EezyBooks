Cleaning Cards for Canon CR-Series Check Scanners (Box of 15) [Office Product]	Check transports accumulate dirt from the pollutants in the environment and by being handled. This dirt collects and clouds the optical lenses inside which are the most critical component of the transport. These optics allow the imaged check to become a legal document for check clearing as stated in the Check 21 law. The ability of the transport to properly create the image is why the optics are the most critical component of the transport.

EZ Screen Wet / Dry Wipes for Touch Screen Monitors, Plasma and LCD Screens	The EZ Screen Wipes will clean sensitive Plasma and LCD televisions, computer monitors, touch screens, handheld game consoles and PDA?s for a crisp picture. The cleaning solution is specially formulated to use on these sensitive screens. The EZ Screen wipes are a two step process: a wet wipe is used to remove finger prints from the sensitive surfaces of today?s monitors. A dry wipe then removes the excess moisture for a clean streak free surface. This product is best used when the monitor or screen is cool. The wipes may also be used on other surfaces such as the plastic casing around the monitors.  This product is alcohol and ammonia free, unlike off the shelf glass cleaners where alcohol and ammonia are prominent ingredients. These solutions maybe harmful to both Plasma and LCD screens and should be avoided.	0521ICE2KYR	EZ Wipe	21.95	5	2011-05-21 07:36:02 PDT		y	1		Fast Shipping - Ships within 24 hours!  100% Satisfaction Guaranteed!	11				B004YPEPTE			1	Domestic		B004YPEPTE			0	DEFAULT
